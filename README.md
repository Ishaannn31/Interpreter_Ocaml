# Mini-OCaml Interpreter

## Overview
This repository contains a **Mini-OCaml interpreter** written in OCaml, developed as part of my university's *Programming 1* course on functional programming. Mini-OCaml is a lightweight interpreter for a subset of OCaml, supporting lexing, parsing, type-checking, and evaluation of expressions. Through this course, Iâ€™ve learned how interpreters work from the ground up and even built parsers and evaluators for small languages during examsâ€”this project reflects that experience!

The code here is based on course material, but Iâ€™ve internalized the concepts and can write similar interpreters independently. Explore, test it, or contributeâ€”Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback!

## Features
Mini-OCaml supports:
- **Lexing:** Converts input strings into tokens (e.g., `if`, `let`, integers).
- **Parsing:** Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with recursive descent and operator precedence.
- **Type Checking:** Ensures type safety (e.g., `int`, `bool`, function arrows).
- **Evaluation:** Computes results with lazy operators, recursion, and closures.

### Supported Constructs
- Basic types: `int`, `bool`
- Constants: Integers (e.g., `42`), Booleans (`true`, `false`)
- Variables and let-bindings: `let x = 5 in x + 3`
- Conditionals: `if e1 then e2 else e3`
- Binary operators: `+`, `*`, `-`, `<=`, `<`, `=`, `<>` (lazy `&&`, `||`)
- Unary operators: `not`, `-` (negation)
- Lambda functions: `fun (x: int) -> x + 1`
- Function application: `f 42`
- Recursive functions: `let rec f (n: int) : bool = if n = 0 then true else not f (n-1)`

---

## How It Works
1. **Lexer (`lex`)**: Turns input into tokens (e.g., `"if true then 1 else 0"` â†’ `[IF; CON(BCON true); THEN; CON(ICON 1); ELSE; CON(ICON 0)]`).
2. **Parser (`parse_exp`)**: Creates an AST, handling operator precedence and nested expressions.
3. **Type Checker (`check_ty`)**: Verifies type correctness (e.g., `if` conditions must be `bool`).
4. **Evaluator (`eval`)**: Executes the AST, supporting lazy `&&`/`||`, closures, and recursion.

Run it with `interpret`:
```ocaml
interpret "let rec f (n: int) : bool = if n = 0 then true else not f (n-1) in f 42"
```
---

## Example

Hereâ€™s a Mini-OCaml program that defines a recursive function and calls it:
ocaml
```
let rec f (n: int) : bool = if n = 0 then true else not f (n-1) in f 42
```

    Output: Bval false (evaluates f 42 by recursively flipping true/false until n = 0).

## How to Run

Local Installation

    Install OCaml (e.g., via opam).
    Compile the code:
    bash

ocamlc -o miniocaml miniocaml.ml
Run it:
bash
./miniocaml
Or use the OCaml REPL:
bash

    ocaml miniocaml.ml
    Then call interpret "your code here".

---

## Online Interpreter

If installing OCaml locally feels cumbersome, test the code online! Copy miniocaml.ml into an OCaml interpreter like:

    SOOCaml (Saarland Universityâ€™s interpreter)
    Try OCaml
    Repl.it

Paste the code, add an interpret call (e.g., above example), and run it!
Project Structure

    miniocaml.ml: Contains all components:
        Helper functions: rev, map, lookup, update, etc.
        Core logic: lex, parse_exp, check_ty, eval, interpret.
        Types: ty (types), exp (AST), token (lexer output), va (values).

---

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project and course:
- Mastered functional programming in OCaml (recursion, pattern matching, higher-order functions).
- Learned to build interpreters: lexing, parsing, type checking, and evaluation.
- Practiced writing parsers/evaluators for toy languages in exams.
- Gained skills applicable to compilers, programming languages, and tech projects.
